## Intro

**Rust** is a memory efficient fast language for low level programming.

## What is all about this repo?

I am very much new to Rust and other low level languages. Such as Go, Rust, C, etc. So, I'm trying to learn Rust to enlearge my knowledge. I'll try to cover up evrything here as much as I can.

## Keypoints

* In Rust we can not write x = y = 10. Because assignment operator does not return value to the variable. In Rust it works different way.
